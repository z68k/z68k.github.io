      <a href="software.html">Software</a> is the page about some software I like but never
      wrote any myself because almost every cool program has already been written by someone
      smarter on the internet and all that's left is to study those seriously.
      <a href="about.html">About</a> is the silly about page I made. <a href="blog.html">Blog
      </a> is the place for potential long form paragraph explanations of things I've figured
      out or I've found to be interesting without any code or math, I aim to explain those in
      plain simple english language and hopefully with cool pictures!
    </p>
	  <p> I have very carefully chosen the color contrast of the body, background and the 
	      font, only using extra colors when necessary so that the overall theme remains
	      easy on the eyes (it's not dark for a reason heh). I kept telling other people
	      that they should have their own websites without actually creating one for myself
	      so I thought may be it's time to start doing that so here I am.
	  </p>
	  <p> More to come... </p>
	  <p> And yeah apparently CSS is harder than C++ :P </p>
	  <p>
	     I'm probably going to have to move the site to a different place. Still figuring out
	     this web stuff. I don't know about you but my shitty K-12 education and even worse
	     college experience (which I ended up dropping out of) combined with a broken family 
	     and illerate toxic parents and somehow you just keep on going while wanting to kill
	     yourself is a pretty near schizo-turning line of events.
	  </p>
	  <p> At this point you're on the brink of insanity, quite really on the verge of 
	      suicide. Disturbing as it sounds, it's true. 
	  </p>
	  <p> You start valuing the basic facts of life, the kind of shit that makes you 
	      question everything, specifically abstract bullshit like "wisdom". That's been my 
	      introduction to "The Real World" where people KILL, RAPE and LIE because they think 
	      it's fun and oh, don't get me wrong, many openly admit to it. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     So, you might ask "Why would I want to listen to a LARPer, who's also a retard, babble
	     about broad open-ended philosophical questions?" and I'd tell you that you don't have 
	     to! You can continue preparing for meme exams or get back to your daily wagecuckery,
	     or whatever I could not care less.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     How is it that I'm alive after all this time and still manage to stay sane while 
	     having literally no real-life friends or close loved ones? Why I am not dead yet? 
	     Well, if you the curious kind you'd easily be able to relate with this. Because it 
	     feels good when you figure something out on your own without much help, it feels 
	     good when you finally understand how a program works! It feels nice when you figure 
	     out an application of some abstract, at first, nonsensical seeming piece of math that 
	     you had never thought you'd be able to understand or EVER apply to anything concrete 
	     :3
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     Little things like that, over time create a snow ball effect. Not something one could
	     have guessed in high school, I think. And remember there's always fun in 
	     "fun-damental"! and don't lookup it's etymology FFS :P
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     BTW <a href="https://noai.duckduckgo.com">ddg</a> without AI slop is pretty nice. Now 
	     I prefer shit that specifically opts out of the LLM crap. Yes it's a feature for me.
	     I don't have time to hold grudges so here's a great html
	     <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/">tutorial</a>, ENJOY :D
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     FWIW the generic AI + web slop is different from experts using local models that are 
	     very specialized and working on non-trivial problems in complexity or information 
	     theory. Important distinction worth noting. I might add a tor mirror later if I ever
	     feel that the stuff I'm posting here is getting too edgy.
	  </p>
	  <p>It's the state of limbo where you're in your head, you know what you need to do but
	    you can't bring yourself to do it. You've given up on life but there's a part of you
	    that wants to keep trying. The action that you take creates the life that you live and
	    you get so caught up in wanting, wishing, all this kind of stuff that you don't act.
	    You've to have a whole scale transformation of your life which is surprisingly easier
	    than people think it is. In your early 20s or late 20s, the only things he does are
	    the things he used to do and does them less and less. He's built an entire worldview
	    around his neurosis. I need some time to think, constantly revisits increasingly skewed
	    memories of the past wondering what he should have done instead. Fixated on things no
	    one actually remembers, probably not even to him at this point. I can't do anything,
	    defeatist who can never quite give up, only boring people get bored that's me. Slowly
	    becoming actually the R word (retard), so let's call it cognitive decline. It was always
	    going to be like this, closest thing to fun or new experiences are ELABORATE FANTASIES,
	    where he reimagines redoing his entire life centered around girls he barely knew in like
	    middle school. Family are the only thing that's keeping him alive. Knows what a schizo
	    is but doesn't know if he is one. If I could do it, I would have by now, no one chooses
	    this. Yeah I was thinking about doing that. Knows it's not too late but wishes it WAS.
	    It only hurts when I laugh, goes months at a time without laughing or sincerely smiling
	    in constant pain. Either neet or wageslave, both equally hopeless. It's not like things
	    can get worse, Um accidentally once felt a moment of relief, has been upset about it
	    since and it's not like things can get better. Developing health problems but justify
	    a crappy lifestyle. Why should I do anything? Cannot accept what he's done is nothing,
	    does nothing in response. He exists in a state of living death, thinking the same
	    thoughts over and over, day in and day out. Even as he understands that thinking doesn't
	    help and he needs to just ACT instead. He's completey overwhelmed by inertia while life
	    passes him by. He's lost everything but can't let go of anything. No reason to live, no
	    reason to die. No reason. Haunted by vague dusty delusions of megalomania. The
	    self-loathing man of inaction. Definitely relatable to Notes From The Underground by
	    Dostoevksky. Anyway.
