	<h1> Software I use </h1>
	<p>This is the start of a para. Lots of really cool programs can be found on the internet
	  and not all of them are impossible to understand or require dark fucking magic to grok.
	  Not every piece of software is metamorphic malware written by god. Some of it though,
	  does require insane amounts to work to take apart and study the machine code. That is
	  rarely the case, by the way. Not everyone wants to audit their own firmware, for
	  example. That'd be very impressive if one can, reverse engineers and binary analysts
	  with decades of experience pull it off like it's one of their daily chores, which is
	  unironcally also true.
	</p>
	<p>However, some computer literacy is always good. Not fancy algorithms, just the bare
	  fundamentals that make the foundation for the modern bloated towers of abstract that
	  we're so used to, though majority of it we don't really need. UI/UX people can kill
	  themselves. Yes I really feel they should not exist. Frameworks upon frameworks are
	  the reason we fell into ruin as soon as we became too reliant on big fat libraries.
	  UNAUDITABLE PILE OF FUCKING POOP!!! God help us.
	</p>
	<p>I also really hate extremists and unix greybeards that fuel those shitty holy wars like
	  they fucking own intel and make their own hardware. They obviously don't and then they
	  start moaning like three-year old girls like someone stole their candy. The modern
	  computers are clearly a capitalist miracle dominated by microsoft and intel in the PC
	  industry. FOSS commies who moan for fucking source code and datasheets, who can't
	  understand how binaries/malware work, should be beheaded by reverse engineers. That'd
	  be once in a lifetime event to see! Very satisfying, indeed.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Operating systems: Windows is fine. Learn how hypervisors work and microsoft
	      "officially" lets you run linux VMs in hyper-V (their virtualization stack) when
	      you need them.
	    <li>Text editors: Hate me for me but I'm an Emacs fan, I think it's great software.
	    <li>Email clients: Anything that lets you read and write plain ASCII text emails is
	      fine. I personally like Mutt and Claws Mail.
	    <li>PDF readers: Zathura and Okular are nice.
	    <li>Standalone sandboxes: Firejail and Sandboxie-plus.
	    <li>Compiler and binary-hacking suite: LLVM
	    <li>Browser: Firefox
  	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>That about covers it.
